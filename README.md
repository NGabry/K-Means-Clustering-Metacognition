# K-Means Clustering
### Utilizing a psychological assesment dataset to find trends in metacognitive abilities

Using mock-data organized in a fashion which resembles results from the Metacognitive Assesment Scale, this repo provides an example of a k-means clustering analysis to identify group trends in metacognitive ability. 

The provided jupyter-notebook contains the full walkhtrough from data cleaning to visualizaitons. 

The dependencies necessary for this analysis are as follows:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn

Please note that this data was manipulated so that obvious clusters could be identified, and does not resemble true findings from a clinical investigation.
